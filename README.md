# Advent of Code 2024 Challenge

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/) programming challenge.

### What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is an annual coding event that takes place from December 1st to December 25th. Each day presents a unique programming puzzle that can be solved using any programming language.

## Motivation
Just to have fun and challenge myself by solving increasingly complex programming problems!

## Repository Structure
